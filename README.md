# PneumoScan

AI-powered pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. 7 deep learning models. Weighted ensemble inference. Built end-to-end in Python.

**Live Demo:** https://yusra-shah--pneumo-scan-serve.modal.run

---

## Overview

A doctor logs in, registers a patient, and uploads a chest X-ray. PneumoScan runs the image through a 7-model ensemble and returns a diagnosis. Every model votes independently. Results include confidence score, severity, subtype, and a Grad-CAM heatmap showing which lung regions influenced the prediction. A PDF report is generated and saved per patient in MongoDB.

All results come from real PyTorch inference on trained weights.

| AttentionCNN | Grad-CAM explainability | 98.67% | 98.13% | 0.00 |
| EfficientNet-B4 | Efficiency and accuracy balance | 98.40% | 98.20% | 0.20 |
| ViT-B/16 | Global pattern detection | 98.13% | 97.73% | 0.17 |
| ResNet-50 | General-purpose feature extractor | 98.47% | 97.67% | 0.18 |
| MobileNetV3 | Speed model, runs first | 97.13% | 97.80% | 0.10 |

Ensemble accuracy: 98.4%

## Advanced DBMS Features

This project was built with MongoDB Atlas as a graded Advanced DBMS requirement. The following features are demonstrated:

**Transactions** — scan results are written atomically. The scan document, model votes, and audit log entry are all committed in a single MongoDB transaction. If any write fails, the entire operation is rolled back.

**Nested documents** — the `scans` collection stores the full ensemble result as a nested structure. Each document contains a `result` subdocument (diagnosis, confidence, severity, subtype) and a `model_votes` array with per-model predictions embedded directly.

**Audit logging** — every login, patient registration, and scan submission is recorded to a dedicated `audit_log` collection with timestamp, doctor ID, action type, and relevant metadata.

**Schema design** — four collections: `doctors`, `patients`, `scans`, `audit_log`. All MongoDB logic is isolated to `database/db.py`. No GUI file imports pymongo directly.

## Dataset

15,000 balanced chest X-ray images. 7,500 Normal, 7,500 Pneumonia.

Sources: Kaggle Kermany dataset, NIH ChestX-ray14, Albumentations augmentation pipeline.

Split: 80% train / 10% val / 10% test, stratified.

## Setup Requirements

**Python version:** 3.12

**MongoDB:** A MongoDB Atlas URI is required. Create a free cluster at mongodb.com/atlas, then add your connection string to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
mongodb_uri: "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/"
```

**Model weights:** The 7 trained `.pth` files are included in the submission folder under `weights/lung/`. Place them there before running. They are not in the GitHub repository due to file size.

## Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yusra-Shah/Pneumo-Scan.git
cd Pneumo-Scan
python -m venv nemo_env
nemo_env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
